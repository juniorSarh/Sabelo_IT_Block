                <h2>1. Skills Gap</h2>
                <p>
                    Over 80% of African IT departments have skills gaps. Globally, IT skills gaps have increased by 155% in three years. They can no longer be ignored, 
                    especially as a lack of necessary skills can be credited for increased employee stress, development and deployment delays, and increased operating costs.
                </p>
                
                <h2>2. Project Management</h2>
                <p>
                   Companies with certified project managers are more likely to have projects that are completed on time and within budget. 
                   It takes experience and strategic thinking to align projects with departmental and organizational goals. 
                   A strong project manager keeps projects on track so deadlines are met, resources are available and leadership is in the loop. 
                   Without someone to steer the ship, projects lack direction and risk increases. 
                   A business that fails to recognize these risks probably doesn it value project management highly.
                </p>
                
                <h2>3. Automation</h2>
                <p>
                    Since workload is the biggest challenge for IT professionals, finding ways to automate more mundane and 
                    time-consuming tasks such as email sends and social media posting is crucial.
                    But companies are now looking to automate larger and more business-critical tasks, 
                    such as cyberattack response, log monitoring and ERP integration
                </p>
                
                <h2>4. CyberSecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity faces numerous challenges, including sophisticated cyberattacks, a global shortage of skilled professionals, 
                    and the increasing complexity of the threat landscape. These challenges are further compounded by the rise of AI-powered attacks, 
                    the expanding attack surface due to the Internet of Things (IoT), and the need for better cloud security. 
                    Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach involving technological advancements, 
                    workforce development, and improved security awareness and practice
                </p>
                
                <h2>5. Cloud Computing</h2>
                <p>
                    Cloud is the top investment area worldwide for IT departments. 
                    Organizations require an infusion of cloud skills to match their monetary investment in cloud platforms. 
                    Much like cybersecurity, cloud professionals are in high demand and short supply. 
                    According to IT decision-makers, cloud computing is the second most challenging hiring area in the world.

            <div id="extraContent" style="display: none;">
                <h2>6. Career Growth</h2>
                <p>
                    A significant number of IT professionals and aspiring tech workers in rural Africa are excluded 
                    from digital opportunities due to a lack of access to devices, affordable internet, and digital skills training. 
                    This creates a divide that slows inclusive economic growth and technological advancement.
                </p>
                
                <h2>7. Analytics and Data Management</h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from cybersecurity and cloud computing, this is the biggest skill gap area for IT departments. 
                    Organizations are struggling to manage a wealth of new data. 
                    By 2025, IDC estimates the world will create and replicate 163 zettabytes (ZB) of data, 10 times the number that was created in 2016.3 New data is constantly accumulating, 
                    creating a host of storage and security risks that must be addressed. 
                    IT professionals are desperately needed to manage this data growth, but the problem has exacerbated because qualified individuals are difficult to come by.
                </p>
                
                <h2>8. Budget</h2>
                <p>
                    A lack of budget and resources is another major concern for both IT staff and decision-makers. 
                    The open-field sections of our IT Skills and Salary Survey are littered with criticisms about budget constraints. 
                    IT professionals want to train but their requests are not always approved by management.
                </p>
                
                <h2>9. WorkLoad</h2>
                <p>
                    Workload, when excessive or poorly managed, presents significant challenges to individuals and organizations. 
                    These challenges can manifest as increased stress, decreased productivity, and even negative impacts on physical and mental well-being. 
                    Effective workload management is therefore crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive work environmen
                </p>
                
                <h2>10. Leadership Support</h2>
                <p>
                    Leadership support, while essential, can be a significant challenge for leaders to provide effectively. 
                    Balancing the need to challenge team members to grow with the need to support them through that growth process requires careful navigation. 
                    This challenge stems from the multifaceted nature of leadership itself, requiring leaders to be both inspiring and supportive, demanding and understanding. 
                </p>

                <h2>11. Digital transformation</h2>
                <p>
                    Digital transformation is latest disrupter. 
                    It has led to technology no longer providing a sustained competitive advantage. 
                    It now plays a supporting role to people with the right skills. 
                    Expertise is needed now more than ever to manage and implement all of the new technologies.
                </p>

                <h2>12. Leadership Support in Prioritizing New Skills Development</h2>
                <p>
                   Some IT decision-makers do not authorize training even when it is built into their budgetâ€”41% had formal training available but decided to forgo it. 
                   Nearly 20% of IT professionals say management does not see a tangible benefit from training. 
                   That is a huge disconnect, especially since IT pros have a strong desire to learn and grow their careers. 
                   It is difficult to accomplish that without support from leadership.
                </p>
