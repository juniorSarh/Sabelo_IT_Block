<h1>Comparison of Windows, Mac, and Linux Operating Systems</h1>


<div class="section">
  <h2>Windows</h2>
  <p>Windows OS is an operating system developed by Microsoft, and it’s one of the most widely used systems in the world for personal computers. It provides the interface you use to interact with your computer—like opening files, browsing the internet, installing programs, and managing your device.</p>
  <h3>File and Folder Organization</h3>
  <p>Windows uses a drive-letter-based hierarchy and a graphical interface centered around File Explorer.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Mac</h2>
  <p>Mac OS, now officially called macOS, is the operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its line of Mac computers. It’s the software that powers everything from startup to shutdown, managing files, programs, internet access, and how you interact with your computer.</p>
  <h3>File and Folder Organization</h3>
  <p>macOS uses a Unix-based hierarchical file system with a clean, user-friendly interface via Finder.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Linux</h2>
  <p>Linux is a free and open-source operating system—just like Windows or macOS, but with a twist: it’s built on collaboration, flexibility, and transparency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since become the backbone of everything from smartphones to supercomputers.</p>
  <h3>File and Folder Organization</h3>
  <p>Linux follows a single-rooted tree structure with everything under / and adheres to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).</p>
